import streamlit as st


# Note: The get_browser_location function has been moved to dashboard.py
# If this file only contained that function, it can be left with just imports.
# If you have other functions/constants needed elsewhere, keep them here.
# For now, leaving just the imports needed by the old get_browser_location signature.

# _WORKING_LOCATION_KEY is now defined and used directly in dashboard.py
